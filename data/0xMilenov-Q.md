### [L-01] Mismatched array lengths can lead to incomplete operations

**Context** 

[Stable2.sol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-basin/blob/7d5aacbb144d0ba0bc358dfde6e0cc913d25310e/src/functions/Stable2.sol#L183-L289)

**Description** 

When multiple arrays are involved in a function and their lengths aren't checked or enforced to be the same, it can result in potential discrepancies during execution.

For instance, if a function processes elements of two arrays in tandem, and one array is shorter than the other, some operations might not be performed for all elements.

It's essential to validate the lengths of arrays to ensure consistent behavior and avoid incomplete or unintended operations.

```solidity
function calcReserveAtRatioSwap(
        uint256[] memory reserves,
        uint256 j,
        uint256[] memory ratios,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external view returns (uint256 reserve) {


function calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity(
        uint256[] calldata reserves,
        uint256 j,
        uint256[] calldata ratios,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external view returns (uint256 reserve) {
```

**Recommendation**  

To prevent these potential issues, better add length checks for the arrays at the beginning of the functions:

```diff
function calcReserveAtRatioSwap(
    uint256[] memory reserves,
    uint256 j,
    uint256[] memory ratios,
    bytes calldata data
) external view returns (uint256 reserve) {
+   require(reserves.length == ratios.length, "Array lengths must match");

}

function calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity(
    uint256[] calldata reserves,
    uint256 j,
    uint256[] calldata ratios,
    bytes calldata data
) external view returns (uint256 reserve) {
+   require(reserves.length == ratios.length, "Array lengths must match");

}
```
