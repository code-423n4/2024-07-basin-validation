## Description
The loop running 255 times to achieve convergence might be inefficient and could be optimized. If convergence is not found within a reasonable number of iterations, the function could be designed to exit early to save gas.


## recommended mitigation
Implement a more efficient convergence algorithm or set a lower iteration limit with early termination when convergence is achieved.


## NC : Misspelling of `Implementation` in Function Names

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-basin/blob/main/src/WellUpgradeable.sol#L93-L107

The function names and variable names consistently misspell 'implementation' as 'implmentation'. This is not a functional issue but a readability and maintainability concern, which may lead to confusion or errors during future code modifications.

## Recommended mitigations
1. Correct the spelling of `implementation` throughout the codebase.
2. Ensure consistency in naming conventions to avoid confusion and potential errors.
