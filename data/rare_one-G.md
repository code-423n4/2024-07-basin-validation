Loop Inefficiencies

The for loops with 255 iterations in calcLpTokenSupply, calcReserve, calcReserveAtRatioSwap, and calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity functions can be costly if the condition to exit the loop is not met early.
Ensure that these loops converge quickly and consider breaking the loop earlier if certain conditions are met.
The Stable2.sol smart contract employs fixed iteration loops with a maximum of 255 iterations to achieve convergence in various calculations related to liquidity and price. Although this guarantees termination, it can result in excessive gas usage if the loop does not converge promptly, impacting the contract's efficiency and potentially leading to high costs or failed transactions.

Affected Code Sections:
Function: calcLpTokenSupply

Affected Lines: Lines 45-55
Description: This function calculates the supply of LP tokens through an iterative process, using a loop with 255 iterations.

for (uint256 i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
    uint256 dP = lpTokenSupply;
    dP = dP * lpTokenSupply / (scaledReserves[0] * N);
    dP = dP * lpTokenSupply / (scaledReserves[1] * N);
    uint256 prevReserves = lpTokenSupply;
    lpTokenSupply = (Ann * sumReserves / A_PRECISION + (dP * N)) * lpTokenSupply
        / (((Ann - A_PRECISION) * lpTokenSupply / A_PRECISION) + ((N + 1) * dP));
    if (lpTokenSupply > prevReserves) {
        if (lpTokenSupply - prevReserves <= 1) return lpTokenSupply;
    } else {
        if (prevReserves - lpTokenSupply <= 1) return lpTokenSupply;
    }
}


Function: calcReserve

Affected Lines: Lines 64-80
Description: Calculates reserve values through iterative approximation, with up to 255 iterations.

for (uint256 i; i < 255; ++i) {
    prevReserve = reserve;
    reserve = _calcReserve(reserve, b, c, lpTokenSupply);
    if (reserve > prevReserve) {
        if (reserve - prevReserve <= 1) {
            return reserve / (10 ** (18 - decimals[j]));
        }
    } else {
        if (prevReserve - reserve <= 1) {
            return reserve / (10 ** (18 - decimals[j]));
        }
    }
}


Function: calcReserveAtRatioSwap

Affected Lines: Lines 129-165
Description: Computes reserve based on a target price, using an iterative approach with up to 255 iterations.

for (uint256 k; k < 255; k++) {
    scaledReserves[j] = updateReserve(pd, scaledReserves[j]);
    scaledReserves[i] = calcReserve(scaledReserves, i, lpTokenSupply, abi.encode(18, 18));
    pd.currentPrice = _calcRate(scaledReserves, i, j, lpTokenSupply);
    if (pd.currentPrice > pd.targetPrice) {
        if (pd.currentPrice - pd.targetPrice <= PRICE_THRESHOLD) {
            return scaledReserves[j] / (10 ** (18 - decimals[j]));
        }
    } else {
        if (pd.targetPrice - pd.currentPrice <= PRICE_THRESHOLD) {
            return scaledReserves[j] / (10 ** (18 - decimals[j]));
        }
    }
}



Function: calcReserveAtRatioLiquidity

Affected Lines: Lines 175-207
Description: Calculates reserve for a given liquidity ratio, using a loop with up to 255 iterations.

for (uint256 k; k < 255; k++) {
    scaledReserves[j] = updateReserve(pd, scaledReserves[j]);
    pd.currentPrice = calcRate(scaledReserves, i, j, abi.encode(18, 18));
    if (pd.currentPrice > pd.targetPrice) {
        if (pd.currentPrice - pd.targetPrice <= PRICE_THRESHOLD) {
            return scaledReserves[j] / (10 ** (18 - decimals[j]));
        }
    } else {
        if (pd.targetPrice - pd.currentPrice <= PRICE_THRESHOLD) {
            return scaledReserves[j] / (10 ** (18 - decimals[j]));
        }
    }

Impact:
>-Gas Consumption: Fixed iteration loops can lead to high gas usage, particularly if convergence is not achieved quickly. For example, if the loop in calcLpTokenSupply iterates 255 times, the gas cost for computations and state changes accumulates, potentially reaching several thousand gas units.

Practical Example:
If calcLpTokenSupply is called with reserves that do not converge quickly, each iteration costs approximately 20,000 gas units. If the loop runs 255 times, the total gas cost could exceed 5,000,000 gas units, making the function costly to execute.

>-Potential Denial of Service (DoS): A function might fail or consume excessive gas if it cannot converge within the allowed iterations, leading to potential Denial of Service. For instance, if the calcReserveAtRatioSwap function cannot find a satisfactory result within 255 iterations, it could revert the transaction or exhaust gas.

Practical Example:
If the function calcReserveAtRatioSwap is used in a high-traffic scenario and the convergence takes 255 iterations, it could cause failed transactions or delays, affecting user experience and potentially leading to a high gas fee or transaction failure.

>-Inefficient Execution: Continuing the loop beyond necessary iterations results in inefficiencies. For example, if the loop in calcReserve achieves convergence after 50 iterations, continuing to 255 iterations wastes gas and computational resources.

Practical Example:
If calcReserve converges within 50 iterations but the loop runs to 255 iterations, it performs 205 unnecessary iterations, consuming extra gas and potentially causing the function to be less responsive.




Mitigations:
Implement Early Exit Conditions:

Add conditions to break out of the loop once sufficient precision or convergence is achieved. This reduces unnecessary iterations and gas costs.

For example:

for (uint256 i = 0; i < 255; i++) {
    // [Calculation code here]
    if (lpTokenSupply > prevReserves && lpTokenSupply - prevReserves <= 1 ||
        prevReserves > lpTokenSupply && prevReserves - lpTokenSupply <= 1) {
        return lpTokenSupply;
    }
}
