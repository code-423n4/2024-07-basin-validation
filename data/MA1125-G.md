I found some divide by zero issue.

dP = dP * lpTokenSupply / (scaledReserves[0] * N);

dP = dP * lpTokenSupply / (scaledReserves[1] * N);

This should be changed to:
if (scaledReserves[0] != 0) {
    dP = dP * lpTokenSupply / (scaledReserves[0] * N);
}
if (scaledReserves[1] != 0) {
    dP = dP * lpTokenSupply / (scaledReserves[1] * N);
}
